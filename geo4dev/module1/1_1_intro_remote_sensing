[Introduction to remote sensing](https://worldbank.github.io/OpenNightLights/tutorials/mod1_1_introduction_to_remote_sensing.html)

In remote sensing, *resolution* can refer to one of three things:
**Spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions**

### Spatial resolution

TODO: add 3 images

Most of this project works with the VIIRS-DNB and DMSP-OLS VNIR band data. 
VIIRS has a spatial resolution of approximately 750m,
while DMSP has about 2.7km.

### Spectral resolution

This is the number and width of spectral bands that the sensor detects.
Higher spectral resolution indicates a narrower wavelength range for a given channel or band.
There can be **multispectral imagery** (3-10 bands) or even **hyperspectral imagery** (100+ bands).

Both VIIRS-DNB and DMSP-OLS data have *single panchromatic* channels covering the wavelengths ranging from 500 to 900 nanometers.
(Visible light ranges from about 380 nm to 740 nm. 900 nm falls into infrared waves.)

### Temporal resolution 

> Temporal resolution refers to the repeat cycle, or frequency, with which a sensor revisits the same part of the Earth’s surface. 
> You might hear this referred to as a satellite’s *revisit time*.

## Trade-offs in resolutions

The tradeoffs work in a triangular fashion. Here's how:
In one case, the higher the spatial resolution, the lower the spectral and the temporal resolution.
In another, the higher the temporal resolution, the lower the spatial and spectral resolutions.

TODO: add triangle


Both VIIRS-DNB and DMSP-OLS data image the same earth location at least twice a day.

# Applications of remotely-sensed derived data in socio-economic research

Here are some mentioned examples:

* Nighttime light can serve as a *proxy for economic activity*, due to the strong correlation 
between nighttime lights and GDP or Gross State Product (GSP). Particularly when 
states don't make data available or when data reported is of low quality or out of date.

* Remotely sensed data can offer a higher spatial resolution than other published or gathered state sources.
It is unconstrained to scales set by political or administrative boundaries.

* Satellite data can be reliable, continuous and consistent, 
regardless of circumstances on the ground, such as political turmoil or natural disasters.
Satellites can observe every location on Earth on a daily or weekly basis.

* Remote sensing observations collect panel data at low marginal cost, 
since the infrastructure and capital costs have already been spent.
