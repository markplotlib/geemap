## Google Earth Engine (GEE) Overview

> Since geographical data are often large and complicated to store, GEE provides a quickly accessible collection of ready-to-use data products. In addition, it is open and free to the public (for non-commercial use).
>
> Because all the datasets are available on the GEE platform, there is no need to manage the data, download them, change the file format, or update the geographic projection
